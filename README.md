In this project neural networks evolve with genetic algorithm to play the Snake game.   
It references npm package [bazJS](https://www.npmjs.com/~bazz) so run "npm install" to get that.   
Sit with patience and let the AI learn to play the game better and better over many generations.   
TensorFlow.js is only used to model neural networks not to train them.
