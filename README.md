In this project neural networks evolve with genetic algorithm to play the Snake game.   
It references [bazJS](https://github.com/PyaBzz/bazJS) so clone that repo as well.   
Sit with patience and let the AI learn to play the game better and better over many generations.   
TensorFlow.js is only used to model neural networks not to train them.
